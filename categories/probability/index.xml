Recently I have been through a hard time to understand the classification methods in Machine Learning. I feel the probability basics is very important to the Machine Learning. In this post, I will write down the formula about probability calculation. I will combine them with Matlab code expression and Matrix manipulate to help me better understand those concept.
Bay&#39;s formula Most frequent used theory in probability.
\[P(E|F) = \frac {P(E\cap F)} {P(E)} , P(E \cap F) = P(E|F)P(F) = P(F|E)P(E) \Longrightarrow P(F|E)=\frac {P(E|F)P(F)}{P(E)}\]</description>
